Final Graded Assessment

Your final graded assessment project takes place across weeks 4-8 and has a total of 32 hours of time allocated.

For the assessment you will be provided with a rough technical specification which you might receive from a teacher. From this specification you will implement a solution and provide a reflective statement to analyse your solution.

You will be provided a starter code (HTML , CSS and JavaScript files) which contain the recommended structure of the app (you would not normally have this provided by a teacher) with missing blocks within the CSS and JavaScript labelled

The comment blocks give descriptions of the missing code. A pass mark for this module can be achieved by just completing the missing code but higher marks will be awarded for improving the style and functionality of the app. Some suggestions for improvements are listed in the project brief.

A teacher wants to encourage their student to practice their times tables. They decided they wanted something more interesting than a series of quiz questions, so they came up with an idea for a times table game based on the standard times table grid. Below you can see their basic idea of the times table grid. A student is asked to find a possible location for a number in the grid. The example given is for the number 35. This could live in row 5 column 7 or row 7 column 5. If either of these is chosen it should reveal the number. If any other choice is made, it should show they have made a mistake at the bottom. The program should keep a count of the mistakes.

A few extension ideas:

Improve styling
Add functionality for a maximum number of mistakes
Extend the grid
